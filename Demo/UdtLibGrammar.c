// NOTE 1: Generator's ApgLib version number = "6.3"

// NOTE 2: The Parser's alphabet character (apg_achar) must be large enough to accommodate the grammar's largest character.
//         Grammar's largest alphabet character = 61
//         Parser's sizeof(apg_achar) must be  >= 1
//         Grammar's largest integer(*)         = 1452
//         Parser's sizeof(apg_uint) must be   >= 2
//
//    (*): sizeof(apg_uint) <= 2 should be used with caution and only for extemely small parsers.
//         The largest integer refers only to the grammar's data. Other Parser integer's may,
//         and likely will, have larger requirements. Parser may fail unpredictably.
