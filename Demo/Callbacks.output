*** DEMO CALLBACKS ***
    - parsing
      - adding callback functions to selected rules
      - overriding the syntax semantically
        - pre-branch syntax error detections
        - post-branch semantically overriding the syntax
      - adding the required callback functions for the UDTs defined in the grammar
    - Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) translation
      - translating rule AST nodes
      - translating UDT AST nodes
      - using the same callback function for both parsing and AST translation
      - using the different callback functions for parsing and AST translation
